In order to reproduce the results, .m files should be opened with MATLAB. And there are separate m-files for each part. The corresponding m-file can be used to reproduce the result.
Note about the moon image: Since the moon image in the extension of .png, matlab takes some pixels values as background. Therefore I changed its extension to .jpg and converted it to gray scale.
